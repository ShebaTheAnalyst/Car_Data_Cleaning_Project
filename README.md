# Data_Cleaning_with_SQL
Data cleaning projects I've done using SQL.

This dataset contained historical sales data, including details such as car features and prices. I inspected the data to make sure it was clean, free from null values, errors, and inconsistencies. I also ran a few queries to make sure the dataset matched the description in the schema.
