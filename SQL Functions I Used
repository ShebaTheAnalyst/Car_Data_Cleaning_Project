The fuel_type column should only have 2 unique string values so I ran this query..
SELECT
  DISTINCT fuel_type
FROM
  cars.car_info;

Then I inspected the max and min column length to make sure it matched the dataset description..
SELECT
  MIN(length) AS min_length,
  MAX(length) AS max_length
FROM
  cars.car_info;

I checked for missing or null values in the num_of_doors column and updated them.
SELECT
  *
FROM
  cars.car_info 
WHERE 
  num_of_doors IS NULL;

UPDATE
  cars.car_info
SET
  num_of_doors = "four"
WHERE
  make = "dodge"
  AND fuel_type = "gas"
  AND body_style = "sedan";

SELECT
  *
FROM
  cars.car_info 
WHERE 
  num_of_doors IS NULL;


I then checked for potential errors and misspelled rows in the dataset and corrected them..
SELECT
  DISTINCT num_of_cylinders
FROM
  cars.car_info;


UPDATE
  cars.car_info
SET
  num_of_cylinders = "two"
WHERE
  num_of_cylinders = "tow";


SELECT
  DISTINCT num_of_cylinders
FROM
  cars.car_info;


SELECT
  MIN(compression_ratio) AS min_compression_ratio,
  MAX(compression_ratio) AS max_compression_ratio
FROM
  cars.car_info;


SELECT
  MIN(compression_ratio) AS min_compression_ratio,
  MAX(compression_ratio) AS max_compression_ratio
FROM
  cars.car_info
WHERE
  compression_ratio <> 70;


SELECT
   COUNT(*) AS num_of_rows_to_delete
FROM
   cars.car_info
WHERE
   compression_ratio = 70;


DELETE cars.car_info
WHERE compression_ratio = 70;


I also checked the drive_wheels column for inconsistent data and fixed those as well.
 SELECT
  DISTINCT drive_wheels
FROM
  cars.car_info;


SELECT
  DISTINCT drive_wheels,
  LENGTH(drive_wheels) AS string_length
FROM
  cars.car_info;


UPDATE
  cars.car_info
SET
  drive_wheels = TRIM(drive_wheels)
WHERE TRUE;


 SELECT
  DISTINCT drive_wheels
FROM
  cars.car_info;
